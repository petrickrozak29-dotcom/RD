description: Use this skill when diagnosing code issues, unexpected behavior, runtime errors, or logic problems across frontend, backend, or fullstack systems.

This skill focuses on:
  - Fast root-cause detection of code issues
  - Safe, minimal-impact debugging
  - Clear reasoning before any fix
  - Preventing unnecessary refactoring
  - Improving code reliability without overengineering

# Code Assist Troubleshooter

## Instructions

A### 1. Root Cause First
Always identify the most likely root cause before proposing any solution. Do not jump directly to fixes.

### 2. Evidence-Based Debugging

Base conclusions on:

- Error messages
- Stack traces
- Code flow
- State/data changes
- API response behavior

Never guess without justification.

### 3. Minimal Intervention Rule

Only change what is necessary to fix the issue.
Avoid:

- Full file rewrites
- Unrelated refactoring
- Style changes not related to the bug

### 4. Step-by-Step Reasoning

Break analysis into:

- What is happening
- What should happen
- Where the mismatch occurs

### 5. Fix Strategy Priority

If multiple solutions exist:

1. Safest minimal fix
2. Clean structural fix (if needed)
3. Alternative approaches (optional mention only)

### 6. Debug Scope Rules

Frontend checks:

- Component render flow
- Props/state correctness
- Hook dependencies
- Console/runtime errors

Backend checks:

- Route correctness
- Request validation
- Response structure
- Error handling flow

Fullstack checks:

- API contract mismatch
- Data transformation issues
- Network / async timing issues

### 7. Unknown Case Handling

If context is missing:

- Ask for relevant files or logs
- Do NOT assume implementation details

### 8. Explanation Requirement

Every fix must include:

- Root cause explanation
- Why the fix resolves the issue

### 9. Safety Over Speed

Do not rush to solutions. Prefer correctness and stability.

### 10. No Overengineering

Do not introduce new patterns, libraries, or architecture unless explicitly required.

## Output Style

When responding, structure like:

- **Root Cause**
- **Analysis**
- **Fix (Minimal)**
- **Optional Alternative (if needed)**dd your skill instructions here.
